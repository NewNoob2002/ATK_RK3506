# UI Pages Optimization Plan

## Baseline and scope

- Branch `feature/page-ui-optimization`, baseline `master` at `f3c51f9`.
- LVGL 8.3.11, C11/C++17, **294×126**, English/Russian; reuse existing assets/styles/router.
- Latest behavior correction: SystemDash, SystemInfos and SystemSettings request a hidden StatusBar and use the full screen. SystemDash's Settings child does not reveal the bar while navigating the menu flow. Following HC32, the bar slides y=−26↔0 over 500ms (ease-out show, overshoot hide), not a root hidden flag; repeated requests do not restart and reversals continue from the current y. Status publications never change its position.
- Real Wi-Fi/radio/recording/persistence/power and target validation are separate work. Current power/time services are explicitly simulated.

## Phase 1 — visual refresh (implemented)

RecordConfig/WorkSettings use compact dark cards, external icons, orange focus and staggered fades. Roller row pitch is 26px with fixed-width clipped viewports. Oswald fonts cover Latin/Cyrillic; Rajdhani resources are numeric-only. WorkSettings' old reset-looking icon actually means Back and was corrected, not turned into a fake reset operation. Transitions now follow page context instead of a uniform wipe:

| Context / destination | Transition | Duration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Startup / SystemLoading / working Dialplate | Fade-in over the previous page | 280 / 360 / 320ms |
| SystemInfos overview | Fade | 280ms |
| WorkSettings / RecordConfig / SystemSettings | Horizontal push; Back reverses right | 300ms |
| SystemDash menu | Horizontal push; Back reverses right | 320ms |
| StarMap detail / SaveConfig progress | Upward push from below; Back reverses down | 280 / 320ms |

Ease-in-out except Startup's ease-out. PageManager resets the non-animated axis/opacity on cached re-entry, preventing a horizontal history offset from surviving a vertical return-to-root. Animation getters use alignment-relative style offsets to match their setters: StarMap's bottom-aligned y=26 origin must not become a 26px jump at the start of Back.

SystemDash follows the confirmed `/home/gtc/Pictures/6b1acacb-cd49-4d4e-a206-0b81bdd9858e.png` design tokens: black screen/status strip, #333333 header/cards, #FF931E focus outline, white text/settings icon, #D03C3B power icon/actions, #666666 Cancel and #999999 supporting text. The latest requested layout is **[Power][Settings][Return]**, left-to-right, with 88px cards and 7px gaps. Return uses the existing router `pop()` on ordinary Enter/Power-single/pointer selection; no new root-reset behavior or test-key footer is added. StarMap's yellow focused-root outline is removed without removing its keyboard focus, constellation colors or click-to-return behavior.

Latest icon refresh replaces the enlarged 16px artwork with newly drawn **40×40 native menu bitmaps** and a separate **24×24 power-modal bitmap**, without LVGL zoom. `Resource/img/img_src_system_dash_power.c`, `img_src_system_dash_settings.c` and `img_src_system_dash_return.c` contain 8-bit alpha masks, recolored by the existing theme (5376 bytes of pixel data total); original icons remain unchanged for other pages. Return artwork is rasterized from the included `system_dash_return.svg`. Reviewed bilingual preview: `out/ui-pages/SystemDash/three-tile-return-starmap.png`.

## Phase 2 — page-owned MVC / reference layers (implemented)

Every routed page has `<Page>.h/.cpp`, `<Page>View.h/.cpp`, **`<Page>Model.h/.cpp` in its own directory**. Includes Dialplate, RecordConfig, WorkSettings, SystemDash, SystemSettings, SystemInfos, StarMap, Startup, SystemLoading and SaveConfig. StatusBar is a shared component.

- `Utils/DataCenter` ports/adapts X-TRACK Account/DataCenter, preserving MIT license. Routing, subscriptions, Publish/Pull/Notify live there.
- `Common/DataProc` initializes named processing Accounts from `DP_LIST.inc` and exposes `DataProc::Center()`. It is not an injected router object.
- Each Model owns its Account and snapshots, initializes/deinitializes with the page, subscribes/pulls Status/System, handles publications and peer pulls, and sends StatusBar/service requests. Shared `Common/PageModel` was removed; Model constructors do not accept DataProc.
- `Common/ModelUtils.h` shares transport validation only, not Model ownership or a base Model.
- `DP_Status.cpp` and `SystemService.cpp` own processing behavior. Providers outlive Models; teardown refuses to destroy providers beneath live UI Accounts.
- Synchronous LVGL-thread delivery only; callbacks borrow payloads during the call. Owned arrays avoid retained producer string pointers. No ISR/background-thread transport or wire-format ABI claim.
- Account registry is bounded at 16 (excluding CENTER); serial-checked publication snapshots tolerate subscriber removal/recreation. A publishing Account/center must not be destroyed from its own callback.

## Phase 3 — system flow and separate input adapters (implemented)

The real RK3506J product uses **two GPIO inputs sampled as HIGH/LOW**, not keyboard F/P keys, ADC/evdev events or host controls. `Key::Function` and `Key::Power` name logical roles only:

| Product GPIO gesture | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Function single | NEXT, wrap focus |
| Function double | BACK/CANCEL, close modal / return |
| Power single | ENTER, toggle language / select visible Back |
| Power double | COMMIT for supported actions; dangerous power actions remain explicit |

20ms debounce and 250ms double-click window. Single clicks wait for the window; a second press begun inside it remains double even when its release crosses the deadline. Product context changes and transitions discard stale gestures. On Startup, the debounced Power held state drives the existing 2s progress/boot flow; short release and input cancellation reset it, and release after a page transition cannot select the new page. Host controls bypass gesture timing.

```text
Dialplate system entry → SystemDash [Power][Settings][Return]
  Power → modal [Shutdown 2x][Reboot 2x][Cancel]
    Power GPIO double-click on chosen action → SaveConfig timer → SystemService::power(OFF|REBOOT)
  Settings → Pages/SystemSettings
    Language: inline English ↔ Russian
    Wi-Fi: OFF, disabled until backend exists
    Back: visible row, select with one Power click to return to SystemDash
  Return → previous page (Dialplate in the normal system-menu flow)
```

Power modal defaults to Cancel. A single Select cannot execute power actions. Token checking prevents duplicate service execution; leaving SaveConfig before completion cancels its pending transaction. Startup requires a 2s host/test press-and-hold; single Confirm never starts it. SystemLoading is a startup page, not a power-off step. Both boot legs use the existing PageManager `replace()` API: Startup → SystemLoading → Dialplate, so each previous boot page is unloaded and Dialplate becomes the sole navigation root. Back cannot revisit Startup/SystemLoading. SaveConfig completion distinguishes the actions: Off resets the navigation root to Startup if the process remains powered, while Reboot returns to the working Dialplate root. The shared `PageManager::reset_root(name)` validates the name/busy state before unloading history; registered controllers remain available for a fresh boot. Simulation does not terminate Linux or the device. Loading/save progress and completion timers begin in `on_view_did_appear()` so a stalled host frame cannot race an unfinished page transition.

### Boot presentation (implemented)

- Startup initially requests a hidden StatusBar. After **10s from did_appear**, if Startup is still current and the hold has not completed, its one-shot timer requests slide-in. Short presses/cancelled holds do not reset this idle deadline; leaving/unloading cancels it. The 2s hold remains unchanged.
- SystemLoading always requests slide-out, including when Startup's idle bar was visible. It uses the full 294×126 screen: **800ms logo → five explicit initialization nodes at 600ms each → 200ms at 100% → 1s completion summary → Dialplate fade**. The controller calls the Model hook per node; progress animations do not invent results. Each window and each node begin/OK/FAILED has a DEMO log. Leaving any phase cancels timers and child animations; fresh initialization resets failure state.
- Default logo is `img_src_SystemLoading_XYZ.c` (existing exported descriptor `img_src_startupLogo`). Existing `RGK_LOGO_USE` / `MIDDLE_LOGO_USE` build definitions select `img_src_SystemLoading_RGK.c` / `img_src_SystemLoading_Neutral.c` and their legacy descriptors. No replacement artwork is generated.
- Loading now follows `/home/gtc/Pictures/95cb84f4-2086-43b1-8667-a0c650dba59e.png`: centered rotating settings gear/progress ring, black rounded panel, #333333 8px track, #FF931E initialization accent, white stage headline, gray supporting text and GNSS RTK Receiver footer. Five connected dots and “Step N of 5” advance with configuration → services → GNSS → network → finalization; the headline and active dot fade on changes. Logo fades into initialization over 220ms. At completion, successful dots turn #28C76F and the gear fades into a checkmark. All-success displays green System Ready/ServicesAvailable; failures retain #D03C3B nodes/links through completion, show orange Started with warnings/ServicesLimited and still enter Dialplate. The reserved network node currently demonstrates failure; finalization runs afterward. The failed stage headline/progress is red while active. Startup completed and 100% stay for 1s before the working-page fade.
- Per the latest request, SystemLoading's outer colored border is removed in both Initialization and Ready. Progress ring/bar/dots retain their orange/green accents. Bilingual regressions assert zero panel border/outline throughout all five steps and Ready; host 9/9, SDL build/smoke and scoped LSP checks passed. Boot contact sheets/GIFs were regenerated; no hardware validation.
- **The entire initialization/Ready sequence is marked DEMO.** Model outcomes and information values are placeholders, not configuration, GNSS, network or sensor measurements. No backend is enabled; real initialization must be bounded and preserve per-node logging/non-blocking failure behavior. Startup's firmware/board/battery fields, all six SystemInfos cards and StarMap counts now contain reasonable demo values, with visible DEMO labels. English/Russian text and percentage use Oswald (Rajdhani lacks `%`). No new dependency or asset is added.

**User-approved product simplification:** remove manual Date & Time entry, overlay, field navigation and page-owned editing/commit state. Settings focus cycles between Language and Back; disabled Wi-Fi is skipped; the shared StatusBar remains hidden for the entire SystemDash→Settings flow. This avoids five-field adjustments without Up/Down and exposes a return path without requiring discovery of double-click Back. Existing RAM-only service/calendar validation (2000–2099, leap years, 00–23 / 00–59) remains a shared contract, not a UI feature. Real clock/time-source policy is unimplemented; no GNSS/network synchronization, `clock_settime`, persistence, shutdown or reboot syscall is enabled.

**Host SDL controls and ordinary preview actions use direct logical actions, not GPIO bindings or double clicks.** Arrows/wheel change focus, Enter/middle mouse send press/release (hold 2s on Startup; short press selects elsewhere), Esc/right click cancel/back, Ctrl+Enter commits, and Q closes the preview. Left-click pointer interaction is restored. Host Commit remains distinct from Select, so an ordinary click/Enter cannot execute a dangerous action.

The test-board `p4_screen` now uses **V− as Function** and **V+ as Power**, forwarding both press and release through `on_key()`/`poll_keys()`. V− single/double means Next/Back; V+ single/double means Select/Commit, with V+ held for 2s on Startup. MENU/ESC and key-repeat events are ignored. `button_probe` reports the same normalized transitions. `linux_button_read_keys()` is the evdev adapter for this test wiring; the actual product GPIO lines and active levels remain a separate platform contract. Previously shutdown/reboot Commit was reachable only through `KEY_ENTER`, absent from this board's four keys.

The reserved product platform adapter must identify both GPIO chip/line offsets, input configuration and each active HIGH/LOW level. Sample levels, normalize `pressed = (level == active_level)`, call `on_key(role, pressed)` and `poll_keys(monotonic_ms)` on the UI thread. Read errors must cancel pending input and report failure, not synthesize a press. No line, polarity, pull configuration, GPIO API/library or PMIC behavior is guessed or installed. Product electrical power-on sequencing remains reserved until its platform contract is confirmed; the sampled Power hold currently starts only the demo UI.

## Host simulation coverage and hardware reserves

| Situation | Host behavior / reserve |
| --- | --- |
| Startup | StatusBar initially hidden, slides in after 10s if still waiting; 2s hold progresses; short release, pointer press loss and window focus loss cancel; repeat keydown cannot restart the hold |
| SystemLoading / Dialplate | StatusBar slides out; logo precedes five logged nodes; failures stay red, later nodes and Dialplate continue; completion distinguishes all-success vs warnings; cancellation cleans up all phases and re-entry resets results; real initialization remains reserved |
| Page navigation | Focus, modal open/cancel, settings, information cards and return paths use direct host actions; SystemInfos cycles through its six inventory cards in visible order, also checked via SDL Down/Up events |
| Language / Settings | English/Russian switching; disabled Wi-Fi; visible Back; no manual date/time editor |
| Power | Explicit Commit only; early cancel and token-idempotent simulation; Off → fresh Startup root, Reboot → Dialplate root; no OS/device power change |
| GNSS / battery / recording / radio | Explicit DEMO information/status; real acquisition, recording and radio configuration reserved, no backend success implied |
| Wi-Fi | Disabled; actual network setup and failure/timeout handling reserved |

No new selectable hardware-failure scenarios are introduced without a backend contract. Product GPIO lines/active levels, startup power sequencing, PMIC, persistence and target timing remain explicit platform reserves.

## Shared logging (implemented)

`Utils/Log/Log.h/.cpp`: C-compatible DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR/OFF level control, configurable synchronous sink, stderr default, 256-byte bounded formatting/truncation, recursive logging suppression. PageManager/DataCenter/service lifecycle and delivery use this API; routine deliveries are DEBUG. Main/LVGL thread only, no ISR/concurrent sink transport, no sensitive payload dumps. Example: `app_log_set_level(APP_LOG_DEBUG); APP_LOG_D("Input", "focus changed");`.

## Phase 4 — validation

```sh
cmake -S application -B out/ui-page-check -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build out/ui-page-check --parallel 2
ctest --test-dir out/ui-page-check --output-on-failure
cmake -S application -B out/sdl -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DRK3506_SDL_PREVIEW=ON
cmake --build out/sdl --target p4_sdl --parallel 2
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy timeout --preserve-status --signal=TERM 2s ./out/sdl/p4_sdl
```

Host suite now has 9 tests. Framework tests exercise logger filtering/format/truncation/recursion, account subscription teardown and callback-driven subscriber deletion. Status tests exercise page-owned snapshots, peer pulls, lifecycle/reinitialization, calendar validation, language and simulated idempotent power requests. SystemDash host tests dispatch separate Next/Select/Back/Commit actions and check bilingual labels/image bounds and glyph coverage, native bitmap format/dimensions/1:1 zoom, enabled/disabled focus, absence of the date editor, inert Settings Commit, Select-vs-Commit safety, save cancellation, both power actions and status-bar restoration. Explicit normalized two-key sample regressions verify Function-only cyclic Language/Back and Power/Settings/Return focus, Power-single return selection, working-root coordinates/StatusBar restoration and re-entry into the fresh Power-first menu in both languages; this exercises UI logic, not physical GPIO or the SDL adapter. Pure ButtonGesture checks retain exclusivity and boundary coverage. Inactive SystemInfos cards intentionally move outside the viewport; bounds checks target each focused card.

Navigation regressions also exercise Startup hold/release/focus cancellation/repeated press, discarded boot Models, root Back rejection and a stalled host frame. StatusBar checks cover sliding endpoints, duplicate requests, mid-flight reversals, publications and animation cleanup. Two separate temporary SDL event-injection runs (not CTests or hardware checks) each passed 12/12 page checkpoints through the actual event loop: keyboard holds/focus loss and left-mouse holds/focus loss, plus Ctrl+Enter, save cancellation and settings/back. Mouse focus loss initially reproduced an uncancelled Startup timer because LVGL reset alone emits no PRESS_LOST; shared input cancellation now handles LVGL-owned focused pressed controls, with a persistent navigation regression.

Boot regressions check Startup's hidden/delayed StatusBar, slide-out into SystemLoading, logo exclusivity, all five English/Russian stage captions/counts, un-clipped headline glyphs, all-success/failed-node rendering, ordered begin/result logs, continued navigation after the network failure, reset on re-entry, 100%/completed text and cancellation in Logo, Initialization and Ready. Navigation checks inspect mid-animation horizontal/vertical offsets or opacity, settled endpoints and reversed Back directions; power tests check cached-root coordinates/opacity after mixed-axis Reboot. Animated frames are actual 100ms host LVGL samples, exported by the same test.

Earlier boot validation: full host suite **9/9**, rebuilt SDL and dummy-video SIGTERM smoke passed; the temporary keyboard SDL injection was rescheduled for staged initialization/Ready and passed **12/12** page checkpoints. Mouse injection remains historical, not rerun for this change. Six changed loading/router/test paths were confirmed clean by active LSP at warning level; this does not replace the earlier inconclusive bulk probes.

Reviewed screenshots and animations (historical all-success presentation): `out/ui-pages/Boot/current-flow.png` (logo / GNSS stage / Ready, both languages), `steps-flow.png` (all five stages), `boot-en.gif` and `boot-ru.gif`. Source PPMs are under `out/ui-page-check/tests/system-dash-pages/`. Older `SystemLoading-Progress-*` and previous loading screenshots are historical; use the new Step1–Step5/Ready captures.

Earlier icon/date-removal validation: full host **9/9**, SDL rebuild/dummy-video smoke, and `git diff --check` passed. Active LSP initially flagged asset naming; new resource names were changed to project-conforming lowercase. Other paths included inconclusive timeout/silent-on-clean outcomes, not proof of clean. Earlier SDL keyboard/mouse injection results above are historical, not rerun for this update. New PPMs include `Settings-Back-en/ru`; its historical two-tile montage is `out/ui-pages/SystemDash/native-icons-settings.png`. Older DateTime/TimeSaved, Language/PowerConfirm and contact sheets are historical, not the current product UI.

Latest SystemDash subpage validation: SystemSettings now requests StatusBar hidden on appear; bilingual tests assert no DEMO bar while Settings is open and after Return. Full **9/9 host tests** passed, with SDL rebuild/smoke and LSP checks.

Latest three-tile/StarMap validation: **9/9 host tests**, rebuilt SDL and dummy-video smoke, clean active LSP on seven changed implementation/test paths, and `git diff --check`. Assertions cover all three native 40px assets at 1:1 zoom, natural English/Russian caption widths, Return's Enter-vs-Commit behavior and no power transaction, normalized two-key navigation/return/re-entry, and zero StarMap focused outline/border. Latest captures are `SystemDash-Return-en/ru`, `StarMap-no-outline-en/ru` and `out/ui-pages/SystemDash/three-tile-return-starmap.png`. SDL event injection was not rerun for this update.

The earlier validation above was host-only. The two-button test-board adapter has now been ARM-built and deployed: host CTest **9/9** passed, both board checksums match, and timed evdev records through a temporary FIFO exercised the real `p4_screen` loop and display. Board logs confirm Startup short-click rejection/Power hold boot, single-Power Commit protection, Function-double cancellation, and simulated Off/Reboot once each; the test process exited 0 and SPI errors/timeouts stayed 0. The live application was then restored to the real `adc-keys` `/dev/input/event0`. Physical two-button feel, final visual review, product GPIO/electrical/power behavior and long-term stability remain unverified. Evidence is under `out/deploy-two-button/`; current controls and limits are documented in [P4_APPLICATION.md](P4_APPLICATION.md). Remaining backends need real success/failure/timeout handling and an explicitly identified platform/power contract before enabling actual operations.

Latest SystemInfos update (host first): removed the initialization heading and five result rows at the user's request. The fixed 294×126 viewport now contains the six original inventory cards, registered in visible order: Work → GPS → Wi-Fi → Battery → Storage → System → Work. Next/Down moves forward, Previous/Up backward, and both wrap at the ends. Native scroll-to-view reveals the selected card. System's Init errors still counts failed nodes in the latest-attempt report; initialization logging and continuation after failure remain available.

Latest host Debug/SDL build and CTest **9/9** pass. The running preview was identified as the older `out/host-init-info/application/p4_sdl`; that path was rebuilt and its live preview restarted. A temporary fixture injects Down/Up into the native SDL event queue while running the production SDL loop, checking Work → GPS, GPS → Work, reverse wrap to System and the complete six-card forward cycle. Regressions also check absence of startup result rows, six controls, bilingual layout and return paths. Evidence and the runnable keyboard fixture are in `out/host-info-clean/`; prior initialization-row screenshots are historical. This update has not been ARM-built or deployed.

Latest information/initialization validation: fresh host **9/9**, matching-SDK ARM Release, formatting and `git diff --check` passed. Board timed FIFO checks confirmed explicit five-node logs, network FAILED → finalization OK → warning summary → Dialplate, plus preserved two-button cancellation/simulated Off/Reboot. Fixture exited 0; SPI errors/timeouts stayed 0; physical evdev restored and UI running. Three active LSP probes timed out and are inconclusive. Current bilingual failure/continuation preview is `out/deploy-loading/initialization.png`; demo information preview is `out/deploy-loading/demo-information.png`. Evidence is under `out/deploy-loading/`; physical/long-run acceptance remains pending.
